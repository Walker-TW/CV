As a recent graduate of Makers Academy I now know three things, first a software developers learning journey is never over. Second communication is key to creating good scalable software and finally I will forever be answering phone calls from my mother about if the computer wants to steal her information....

I have always liked building things, breaking them and then solving how I broke them. While my past employment (Bartending and Teaching) allowed me to solve problems and build things (ie. cocktails) I never really got to build things that are longer lasting or deeply complex.
So while working my previous jobs I began learning to program on my own using online resources (CS50, "Learn Python the Hard Way") and then started Makers Academy in December 2019.

There is a lot to love about development but I have learnt that the ease of creation, adaptability of projects and continuous personal skill development are my favourite parts of the process. With this in mind and armed with my bootcamp knowledge alongside my Philosophy & History degree I am now looking for a full-stack junior developer role. Ready willing and excited to find out how this here internet works.

A visualiser web app that displays a randomised animated canvas image that uses the information brought in via Spotify's API's. Users can sign in using OAuth and link their Spotofy account as well as gain access to hidden Spotify data such as 'danceability' of a track. Created using a front end built in ReactJS and a back-end in Node.JS |ReactJS, Node.JS, HTML, CSS, Express, Bootstrap|

Allows users to login, logout, create messages and choose a home planet. I also blogged the creation of the app [here](https://medium.com/@TWWalker/dosdosdesperadosdynamicos-acebook-not-a-copy-of-facebook-honest-f9e53b543aee). | Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Travis, RSpec, Capybara|

It will take created users and their tweets and add to a local database as well as upcase them on the front-end (because the birds are the loudest things known to man).|Ruby, HTML, CSS, Rspec, PSQL|

## Skills

#### Research/Learning

As a History & Philosophy graduate I had a heavy research based course-load, focused on not just when things happened but the driving ideals behind them. The dual nature of my course required extensive knowledge of multiple fields which could then be combined into a new idea.

Since leaving university I have taught myself a number of different skills in a wide variety of roles.
These skills include teaching myself Python before joining Makers Academy a highly selective bootcamp focusing on Ruby, SQL, JavaScript and TDD. A maxim at Makers is to "Never Stop Learning" and so there I also created a project in React (not taught on the course) and Node.JS.

As a native English speaker teaching adults ESL I had to learn the ins and outs of different esoteric grammar points to a standard that I could then teach them in an interesting and easily digestible way. This shows that I can take complex concepts and illustrate them to professionals outside the area of expertise.

#### Communication

Makers curriculum is pair based programming. Therefore, I am well versed in working in small teams with people of varying outlooks and technical knowledge to create software. This experience solidified my knowledge that communication is key in the all aspects of tech.

I also had the unique experience of living and working in a small town (Gyeongju) in South Korea where daily communication was made more difficult by a severe language barrier. So I began to develop my communication skills learning Korean, taking extra care to ensure clarity with my co-workers and integrating myself in the community. I take pride in having developed my communication skills so that I can be understood by anyone. This all came in my hospitality career, both as a supervisor in charge of multiple individuals as well as a bartender with patrons.

Overall my experience tecahing and in hospitality has made me a strong communicator and much more sensitive to how important it is in all aspects of work. 

#### Self-Driven

My first line of code was written in Python on a Thursday and by that Monday I had over 2000 lines of code in my starting directory (none of it was that great). Yet I was hooked, and after contacting various people in the industry the best way to break in, I chose Makers Academy because it is a self lead curriculum. There I ran retro's for my entire cohort, planned group Meet-ups and based on my own interest in Spotify data sketched out [my final project](https://github.com/Walker-TW/Front-End-Vishual), set group goals and drove my team to project completion.

Additionally, I have a continuous track record of completing self made goals. The most demonstrable of these is my love of travel which often sees me setting a place to live or visit and then overcoming finical, personal and bureaucratic obstacles to achieve this. From dealing with month long visa processes to working two jobs to pay for dream travel to building a bed in the back of my car and driving Australia's interior. I use this self drive not only to pursue my personal but my work objectives as well.

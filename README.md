As a recent graduate of Makers Academy I now know three things, first a software developers learning journey is never over. Second communication is key to creating good scalable software and finally I will forever be answering phone calls from my mother about if the computer wants to steal her information....

I have always liked building things, breaking them and then solving how I broke them. While my past employment (Bartending and Teaching) allowed me to solve problems and build things (ie. cocktails) I never really got to build things that are longer lasting or deeply complex.
So while working my previous jobs I began learning to program on my own using online resources (CS50, "Learn Python the Hard Way") and then started Makers Academy in December 2019.

There is a lot to love about development but I have learnt that the ease of creation, scalability of projects and continuous personal skill development are my favourite parts of the process. With this in mind and armed with my bootcamp knowledge alongside my Philosophy & History degree I am now looking for a full-stack junior developer role. Ready willing and excited to find out how this here internet works.

|<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/Walker-TW/Front-End-Vishual"><img src="./images/GitHub-120px.png"  height="32" width="32"></a></p>| __'The Vishual Project'__, - A 2 week 'final project' from my time at Makers Academy. A visualiser web app that displays a randomised animated canvas image that uses the information brought in via Spotify's API's. Users can sign in using OAuth and link their Spotofy account as well as gain access to hidden Spotify data such as 'danceability' of a track. Created using a front end built in ReactJS and a back-end in Node.JS |ReactJS, Node.JS, HTML, CSS, Express, Bootstrap|

Allows users to login, logout, create messages and choose a home planet. I also blogged the creation of the app [here](https://medium.com/@TWWalker/dosdosdesperadosdynamicos-acebook-not-a-copy-of-facebook-honest-f9e53b543aee). | Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Travis, RSpec, Capybara|
|<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/Walker-TW/Chitter-Challenge"><img src="./images/GitHub-120px.png"  height="32" width="32"></a></p>| __'Chitter!'__ - A project from halfway through the Makers course in which I have created a twitter clone built around Capybara's. It will take created users and their tweets and add to a local database as well as upcase them on the front-end (because the birds are the loudest things known to man).|Ruby, HTML, CSS, Rspec, PSQL|
